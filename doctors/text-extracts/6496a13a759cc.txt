PURPOSE OF THE FORM:

This form will allow excavation staff to assess the physical, mental, and emotional fitness of the applicant and
to alert applicants who may not be medically fit for strenuous work and difficult living conditions on the
excavation to reconsider their application. Living under stressful conditions and in a semi-tropical environment
may cause otherwise minor ailments to become significant problems and may alter the effects of some
medications. On many excavations participants experience recurrences of physical problems or problems with
their medications which have adversely affected their participation. As a result, some persons require special
medical attention that is available only at a hospital and others are often forced to leave prematurely. We ask,
therefore, that you be completely candid in completing this. Failure to disclose known medical conditions may
jeopardize your participation.
